This project investigates medical appointments in Brazil in 2016 to determine why a person will make an appointment with a doctor and be absent on the visitation day. This has been the case in brazilian health sector over the years and even though a mitigating option, reminder by sms, was employed, there seem to be no visible change in the responses of people to scheduled visits. 
The goal of this project is to understand these questions:

>1. Do patients under the Brazilian welfare scholarship program show up more than other patients?
>2. Does receiving reminder messages influence honoring appointment schedules?
>3. What age group is most registered for health check up? Which show up more?
>4. Does the number of days between appointment and scheduled date have an effect on the showing up of a patient?
>5. Which gender predominantly showup for appointment?
